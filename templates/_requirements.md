# System Requirements

## Overview

This file defines both the functional/non-functional requirements and mandatory design constraints that any proposed architecture must satisfy. Requirements serve as acceptance criteria for evaluating design proposals, while constraints represent technical limitations or strategic decisions that limit the solution space.

**Usage**: Reference these requirements and constraints when designing system components, evaluating trade-offs, and validating that proposed solutions meet all specified criteria. All design proposals must comply with the constraints listed here.

## Mandatory Design Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- [Add your technical constraints here]
- [Example: Must use existing authentication system]
- [Example: Cannot exceed current latency SLAs]

### Business Constraints
- [Add your business constraints here]
- [Example: Must maintain backward compatibility]
- [Example: No changes to existing APIs]

### Compliance Constraints
- [Add your compliance constraints here]
- [Example: Must comply with data residency requirements]
- [Example: Must maintain audit trails]

### Infrastructure Constraints
- [Add your infrastructure constraints here]
- [Example: Must run on existing hardware]
- [Example: Cannot introduce new dependencies]
